# Who am I?   

I have a strong passion for using research, colors, design, and code to make a positive impact on both humans and animals. 

I'm the enthusiastic individual who can often be heard shouting at the top of my lungs, eagerly requesting someone to pass me the ‚öΩ. Additionally, I enjoy spending time with my beloved Tagabouts characters from my comic strips. Also challenging the waves of the ocean to assert my dominance and, admittedly, indulging in a plethora of üçüs more often than I should.
